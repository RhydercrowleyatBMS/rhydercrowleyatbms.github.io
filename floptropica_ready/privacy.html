This is a tiny, chaotic chat project made by friends, for friends.

There is effectively no privacy here:
• Messages you send can be seen by anyone in the same room.
• Rooms may be temporary, but while they exist, the content is public.
• We do not promise security, encryption, or real data protection.
• This is not a professional service — it is a school / hobby project.

Translation:
do not post anything sensitive, personal, illegal, or that you will regret.

By using Floptropica, you’re basically saying:
“I understand this is all public and I’m okay with that.”

If you want actual privacy, don’t use this site for anything serious.

          System note: There is zero guaranteed privacy on Floptropica.
          Treat every message like it could be seen by anyone in your group.
