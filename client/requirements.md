## Packages
framer-motion | Essential for the "shake", "flash", and text typing animations required by the horror theme
uuid | For generating the client-side session ID

## Notes
Tailwind Config: Extended font families for 'mono' (Geist Mono, Fira Code) to achieve the terminal aesthetic.
Animation: Heavy use of framer-motion for UI distortion and glitch effects.
State: Session ID and API Key stored in sessionStorage/Context for privacy.
