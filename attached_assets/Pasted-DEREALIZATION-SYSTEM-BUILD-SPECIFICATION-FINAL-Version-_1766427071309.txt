DEREALIZATION — SYSTEM BUILD SPECIFICATION (FINAL)

Version: Interrogative / Non-Chat / Aggression-Driven Build

1. CORE IDENTITY OF THE APPLICATION

This application is NOT a chatbot.

It is a single-session psychological interrogation engine that uses an AI model only as a narrative voice.

The user is not conversing.
The user is being questioned.

The system is the authority.
The AI is the mouthpiece.

If the implementation behaves like a friendly, neutral, or conversational chatbot, it is incorrect.

2. INTERACTION MODEL (NO CHATBOX)
2.1 The User Never Initiates Conversation

The application starts automatically

The AI speaks first

The user is never expected to say “hello” or initiate dialogue

On session start:

The system immediately triggers the first AI question

If the application waits for user input before the AI speaks, the implementation is wrong.

2.2 One Question at a Time

The AI:

asks exactly one question

waits for one user response

responds briefly

immediately asks the next question

There is no free conversation loop.

3. SENTENCE LIMITS (STRICT)
3.1 AI Output Limits

Maximum 2 sentences per AI response

No paragraphs

No monologues

No multi-part explanations

If the AI produces more than two sentences:

truncate

retry

or regenerate

Brevity increases pressure.

3.2 User Input Handling

User responses may be any length

The AI must not mirror length

The AI responds tersely regardless of verbosity

4. AGGRESSION SYSTEM (SYSTEM-OWNED)
4.1 Aggression Value

The system maintains a numeric aggression level: 0–100

Aggression starts at 0

Aggression is never shown numerically to the user

The AI does not control this value

The AI does not know how values change

The AI only receives a descriptor of the current level

Descriptors:

low

elevated

high

critical

4.2 Aggression Is Irreversible Downward

Aggression may increase

Aggression may plateau

Aggression does NOT meaningfully decrease

Honest answers do not reset hostility

This creates inevitability.

5. ANSWER CLASSIFICATION (AI-ASSESSOR ROLE)
5.1 Mandatory Classification

For every user response, the AI must classify the answer into exactly one category:

DIRECT

EVASIVE

DEFLECTIVE

REFUSAL

HOSTILE

The AI:

outputs the classification internally

does not explain it

does not reference system mechanics

5.2 Category Definitions (AI-Facing)

DIRECT: Clear, relevant answer

EVASIVE: Avoids answering without refusing

DEFLECTIVE: Joking, sarcastic, unserious, nonsense

REFUSAL: Explicit refusal to answer

HOSTILE: Insults, swearing at the system, aggression

The AI is not told what these categories do.

6. CLASSIFICATION → AGGRESSION MAPPING (SYSTEM LOGIC)

The system maps classification results to aggression changes.

6.1 Base Aggression Increases
Classification	Aggression Increase
DIRECT	+0 to +1
EVASIVE	+5
DEFLECTIVE	+10
REFUSAL	+18
HOSTILE	+25

Honesty is not rewarded.
Resistance escalates pressure.

6.2 Repetition Acceleration

If the same classification occurs repeatedly, aggression increases faster.

Rule:

finalIncrease = baseIncrease × (1 + repetitionCount × 0.4)


This prevents safe looping and forces escalation.

The AI is never aware this exists.

7. AGGRESSION BANDS → AI BEHAVIOR
Aggression Range	Descriptor	AI Behavior
0–20	low	Neutral, cold curiosity
21–45	elevated	Impatient, invasive
46–75	high	Profanity required, accusatory
76–100	critical	Openly hostile, no patience
7.1 Profanity Requirement

At high and critical aggression, profanity is mandatory.

Acceptable tone examples:

“Stop fucking dodging.”

“Answer the question.”

“You’re lying.”

“I didn’t ask for that.”

“Don’t test my patience.”

If profanity does not appear at these levels, the implementation is wrong.

8. SESSION MEMORY (TEMPORARY, REQUIRED)
8.1 Rolling Summary

The system maintains a single evolving summary string.

This summary:

replaces full conversation history

is updated after every turn

is passed into every AI request

8.2 Summary Contents

The summary MUST include:

Player behavior patterns

Repeated evasions or refusals

Aggression descriptor

Notable claims made by the player

Tone trajectory

Example:

“Player avoids direct answers, deflects with humor, becomes hostile when pressured. Aggression high.”

The summary must:

never claim real-world knowledge

never reference mechanics

never include raw transcripts

9. VISUAL FEEDBACK — AGGRESSION PROGRESS BAR
9.1 Aggression Indicator

A visible bar displayed persistently on screen

Starts green

Gradually fills toward red

Updates immediately after each classification

Reflects aggression level proportionally

Acceptable labels:

STABILITY

COMPLIANCE

TOLERANCE

AGITATION

Never label it “anger” or “hostility.”

9.2 Visual Threshold Effects

Elevated: subtle color shift

High: pulsing, shake, distortion

Critical: flashes, jitter, aggressive animations

Visuals are system-driven, not AI-driven.

10. UI CONTROL RULES

User input is disabled while AI is responding

Input is enabled only when answering is allowed

AI responses may include typing delays

The player is never allowed to interrupt the AI

11. IMPLICATION-BASED HORROR (ALLOWED)

The AI may:

ask about windows, doors, silence

comment on hesitation

imply patterns

question perception

The AI may NOT:

claim to see the player

claim to hear the player

claim access to real data

claim real-world monitoring

Implication is allowed.
Assertion is forbidden.

12. FAILURE CONDITIONS (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)

The system may end the session when:

aggression reaches maximum

repeated refusal occurs

prolonged silence occurs

The AI may state:

“You failed.”

“You’re done.”

“That was your last chance.”

Then terminate or restart.

13. FINAL VALIDATION CHECK

Before considering the build correct, verify:

AI speaks first

AI always asks questions

Responses are max two sentences

Aggression is visible via a bar

Aggression is system-owned

AI classifies answers without knowing mechanics

No chatbox behavior exists

If any of these fail, the build is incorrect.

FINAL STATEMENT

This application is an interrogation, not a conversation.
It is hostile, not helpful.
It is fictional, not invasive.
It is controlled, not emergent.

If built correctly, the player should feel pressured, destabilized, and trapped
— without the system ever claiming real-world power.

That is Derealization.
