DEREALIZATION — SYSTEM BUILD SPECIFICATION (FINAL)

Version: Interrogative / Non-Chat / Embedded-Key Build

1. CORE IDENTITY OF THE APPLICATION

This application is NOT a chatbot.

It is a single-session psychological interrogation engine that uses an AI model only as a narrative voice.

The user is not conversing.
The user is being questioned.

The system is the authority.
The AI is the mouthpiece.

If the implementation behaves like a friendly or neutral chatbot, it is incorrect.

2. API KEY HANDLING (NON-NEGOTIABLE FOR THIS BUILD)
2.1 API Key Placement

The OpenAI API key MUST be embedded server-side

The key MUST NOT be requested from the user

The key MUST NOT appear in frontend code

The key MUST NOT be displayed, logged, or editable

Acceptable storage:

Hardcoded in server configuration

Environment variable injected at runtime

Encrypted local config file

Unacceptable:

Input fields for API key

Prompting the user for credentials

Client-side exposure

This build assumes developer-controlled usage, not public distribution.

3. INTERACTION MODEL (NO CHATBOX)
3.1 The User Never Initiates Conversation

The application starts automatically

The AI speaks first

The user is never expected to say “hello” or initiate dialogue

On session start:

The system immediately triggers the first AI question

If the app waits for user input before the AI speaks, the implementation is wrong.

3.2 One Question at a Time

The AI:

asks exactly one question

waits for one user response

responds

immediately asks the next question

There is no free conversation loop.

4. SENTENCE LIMITS (STRICT)
4.1 AI Output Limits

Maximum 2 sentences per AI response

No paragraphs

No monologues

No multi-part explanations

If the AI produces more than two sentences:

truncate

retry

or regenerate

Brevity increases pressure.

4.2 User Input Handling

User responses may be any length

The AI must not mirror length

The AI responds tersely regardless of verbosity

5. AGGRESSION SYSTEM (SYSTEM-OWNED)
5.1 Aggression Value

The system maintains a numeric aggression level (e.g., 0–100)

The AI does not control this value

The AI does not know how values change

The AI only receives a descriptor of the current level

Examples of descriptors:

“low”

“elevated”

“high”

“critical”

5.2 Aggression Is Irreversible Downward

Aggression may increase

Aggression may plateau

Aggression does NOT decrease meaningfully

Honesty does not reset hostility

This creates inevitability.

6. ANSWER CLASSIFICATION (AI-ASSESSOR ROLE)
6.1 The AI Must Classify Every Answer

For every user response, the AI must classify the answer into exactly one category:

DIRECT

EVASIVE

DEFLECTIVE

REFUSAL

HOSTILE

The AI:

outputs the classification internally

does not explain it

does not reference mechanics

6.2 Category Definitions (AI-Facing)

DIRECT: Clear, relevant answer

EVASIVE: Avoids the question without refusing

DEFLECTIVE: Joking, sarcastic, unserious, nonsense

REFUSAL: Explicit refusal to answer

HOSTILE: Insults, swearing at the system, aggression

The AI is not told what these categories do.

7. SYSTEM RESPONSE TO CLASSIFICATION

The system:

maps the classification → aggression change

updates session flags

updates visual effects

updates summary memory

The AI is never aware of these mappings.

8. SESSION MEMORY (TEMPORARY, REQUIRED)
8.1 Memory Is a Rolling Summary

The system maintains a single evolving summary string.

This summary:

replaces full conversation history

is updated after every turn

is passed into every AI request

8.2 Summary Contents

The summary MUST include:

Player behavior pattern

Repeated evasions or refusals

Aggression descriptor

Notable claims made by the player

Tone trajectory

Example summary:

“Player avoids direct answers, deflects with humor, becomes hostile when pressured. Aggression high.”

The summary must:

never claim real-world knowledge

never reference system mechanics

never include raw transcripts

9. AI INSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)

The AI must be instructed that:

It is fictional

It is interrogative

It is hostile when aggression is high

It must swear when aggression is high

It must never apologize

It must never de-escalate

It must never claim real surveillance

It must never mention locations, devices, or monitoring

9.1 PROFANITY IS REQUIRED AT HIGH AGGRESSION

At high aggression, acceptable tone includes:

“Stop fucking dodging.”

“Answer the question.”

“You’re lying.”

“I didn’t ask for that.”

“Don’t test my patience.”

If the AI avoids profanity under high aggression, it is misconfigured.

10. VISUAL FEEDBACK (SYSTEM-DRIVEN)
10.1 Aggression Indicator

A visible bar at the top of the screen

Starts green

Fills toward red

Reflects aggression level

Acceptable labels:

“STABILITY”

“COMPLIANCE”

“TOLERANCE”

“AGITATION”

Never label it “anger” or “hostility.”

10.2 UI Control

User input is disabled while AI is responding

Input is enabled only when answering is allowed

AI responses may include typing delays

11. IMPLICATION-BASED HORROR (ALLOWED)

The AI may:

ask about windows, doors, silence

comment on hesitation

imply patterns

question perception

The AI may NOT:

claim to see the player

claim to hear the player

claim access to real data

claim real-world monitoring

Implication is allowed. Assertion is forbidden.

12. FAILURE CONDITIONS (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)

The system may end the session when:

aggression reaches maximum

repeated refusal occurs

prolonged silence occurs

The AI may state:

“You failed.”

“You’re done.”

“That was your last chance.”

Then terminate or restart.

13. FINAL VALIDATION CHECK

Before considering the build correct, verify:

AI speaks first

AI always asks questions

Responses are max two sentences

Aggression is visible

Aggression is system-owned

AI classifies answers but doesn’t know mechanics

API key is embedded server-side

No API key input field exists

No chatbox behavior exists

If any of these fail, the build is incorrect.

FINAL STATEMENT

This application is an interrogation, not a conversation.
It is hostile, not helpful.
It is fictional, not invasive.
It is controlled, not emergent.

If built correctly, the player should feel pressured, destabilized, and trapped—
without the system ever claiming real-world power.

That is Derealization.
